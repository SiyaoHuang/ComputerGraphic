Any problems with your solution
There is no is shadow in BSDF, I copy the one in PointLight there.

Anything else you want us to know. 
Create mess.xml under bsdfSampling. Put a glass sphere in front of a square area light. The light is upside down in the sphere. I like the feeling of rect-plane-bsdf.xml. It is beautiful.
